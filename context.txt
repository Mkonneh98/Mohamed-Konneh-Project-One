Hello, my name is Mohamed Konneh and this is really one of my first design classes for web design. My racial background is Liberian 100% and i am first generation to be born in America. I am excited about this class because i see myself doing this in the future full time because web design seems so fun and you can really be creative with your creations, as well as have a lot of people utilize it. Almost every company has or needs a website that catches the eye, explains information and also is easy to get through. I know sitting at a computer for hours on end is really difficult or boring for some people, but for me sitting there and playing with websites is a great time.

my aspirations and dreams for this class is to be able to create a website that i can call my "Portfolio" because a lot of places i want to apply to ask for one and honestly i feel bad that i dont even have one yet. I would love
